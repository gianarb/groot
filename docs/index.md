# What is Penny?
Penny is a framework that helps us to build middleware applications, it is based on an event system and allows us to combine the perfect libraries for our application.

# Perfect Libraries
PHP has a very powerful open source ecosystem. There are a lot of developers and a lot of companies that work and put effort  on some of the best libraries with which we can use to build our applications.
Penny was born to manage integration between our favorite libraries and it does not force us to use nothing we don't want to.

# The Core
Penny is very easy its core is built using [PHP-DI](http://php-di.org) a strong dependency injection library.
In its base implementation it uses [nikic/FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute) a fast regular expression based router.

# The cost of freedom
This freedom requires a strong knowledge of the Dependency Injection pattern and a deep understanding of the open source ecosystem is essential to choose the perfect mix of libraries with which build our application.

Here are a [list of implementation examples](/docs/use-case.md) to help us with our development process.
